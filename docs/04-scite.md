# #scite parser

`{{#scite:}}` parser can only be used in [namespaces][smw-ns] that are enabled
for Semantic MediaWiki.

```
{{#scite:Byrne 2008
 |type=journal
 |author=Byrne, A
 |year=2008
 |title=Web 2.0 strategies in libraries and information services
 |journal=The Australian Library Journal
 |volume=57
 |number=4
 |pages=365-376
}}
```

## Reserved parameters

Parameters (or identifiers) are free from any restrictions
besides those listed below:

- `type` is a reserved parameter
- `reference` is a reserved parameter and is linked to the `Citation key` property
- `citation text` is a reserved parameter and is linked to the `Citation text` property
- `sortkey` is a reserved parameter and is linked to the `_SKEY` property and can be
  set to find a resource more easily during querying as the resource is by default set
  to the internal resource id.
- `bibtex` is a reserved parameter and used for the bibtex record import
- `template` is reserved to define a preferred template for output processing
- Other reserved parameters include `doi`, `pmcid`, `pmid`, `olid`, `oclc`, and `viaf` linking
  to its representing property

## Citation key

A citation resource is expected to be identifiable by a unique key and to be available
wiki-wide therefore selecting an appropriate key is paramount to safeguard against
unnecessary changes.

The reference parameter is the descriptor for that key. For example, to describe
a `Byrne 2008` resource the short or the explicit reference parameter form can be used.

```
{{#scite:Byrne 2008
  ...
}}
```
```
{{#scite:
  |reference=Byrne 2008
  ...
}}
```

If it becomes necessary to rename a citation key (because a resource with key `Foo 2007`
no longer represents a unique resource due to adding another resource with the same key)
then it is recommended that the existing usage is queried and changed before applying
the new citation key (e.g. `Foo 2007a`).

## Citation text

The property `Citation text` contains the formatted output of a citation resource and is
used when the [referencelist](05-referencelist.md) is generated. The text is formatted either by
an assigned template or can be added directly (without further processing) in its final form
to the `|citation text=` parameter.

```
{{#scite:Einstein 1956
 |type=book
 |citation text=Einstein, Albert. Investigations on the Theory of the Brownian Movement. Courier Corporation, 1956.
}}
```

In case the parameter `|citation text=` is not declared then `#scite` is going to try to determine
a template by first looking at the `|template=` parameter and if such parameter is not assigned
then the [template](03-template-mapping.md) mapped to the type of the resource
is used for processing to return a formatted text value.

```
{{#scite:Einstein 1956
 |type=book
 |authoru=Albert Einstein
 |title=Investigations on the Theory of the Brownian Movement
 |publisher=Courier Corporation
 |year=1956
 |template=FormatThisEntityAccordingToHarvardStyle
}}
```

If `$GLOBALS['scigEnabledCitationTextChangeUpdateJob']` is set true then an alteration to
a citation text will initiate an update job for those pages that make reference to the
changed citation resource.

## Type assignment

A type assignment is required for each citation resource unless `$GLOBALS['scigEnabledStrictParserValidation']`
is set `false`.

If multiple types are assigned (e.g.`|type=bgn:Thesis;schema:Book|+sep=;`) then
the last entry (e.g. `schema:Book`) will be used as type descriptor.

## Bibtex record import

To ease the reuse of bibtex records, `#scite` provides the `|bibtex=` parameter to
import a bibtex formatted text to create an annotatable record that corresponds to
the mapping found in the [property](02-property-mapping.md) and
[template](03-template-mapping.md) page.

```
{{#scite:
 |bibtex=@ARTICLE{Meyer2000,
AUTHOR="Bernd Meyer",
TITLE="A constraint-based framework for diagrammatic reasoning",
JOURNAL="Applied Artificial Intelligence",
VOLUME= "14",
ISSUE = "4",
PAGES= "327--344",
YEAR=2000
}
}}
```

### Bibtex author list

Authors (e.g. `Einstein, Albert and Podolsky, Boris and Rosen, Nathan`) will be split
into an author list of natural representations (`Albert Einstein` etc.) while the original
annotation string is still available using the hidden `bibtex-author` parameter.

```
{{#scite:
 |bibtex=@article{einstein1935can,
  title={Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?},
  author={Einstein, Albert and Podolsky, Boris and Rosen, Nathan},
  journal={Physical review},
  volume={47},
  number={10},
  pages={777},
  year={1935},
  publisher={APS}
}
}}
```

### Bibtex content formatting

`@article` is parsed as type `article` that can be assigned to a specific [template](03-template-mapping.md)
containing the rules of how text elements are to be formatted. Please be aware
that no automatic clean-up is done on elements like containing `{`/`}` or `in \n SUSY`, and
complex expressions (those involve macros etc.) are
not parsed or resolved.

```
{{#scite:
 |bibtex=@article{Marshakov:2010si,
      author         = "Marshakov, A.",
      title          = "{Period Integrals, Quantum Numbers and Confinement in
                        SUSY QCD}",
      journal        = "Theor. Math. Phys.",
      volume         = "165",
      year           = "2010",
      pages          = "1650-1661",
      doi            = "10.1007/s11232-010-0135-y",
      note           = "[Teor. Mat. Fiz.165,488(2010)]",
      eprint         = "1003.2089",
      archivePrefix  = "arXiv",
      primaryClass   = "hep-th",
      reportNumber   = "FIAN-TD-02-10, ITEP-TH-05-10",
      SLACcitation   = "%%CITATION = ARXIV:1003.2089;%%"
}
}}
```
## Citation meta record

`$GLOBALS['scigEnabledCitationMetaRecord']` can be enabled to generate additional record data about the
references used (e.g citation frequency) to help answer questions like "How often is a reference cited
within an article?" or "How often is a reference cited within a wiki?.
